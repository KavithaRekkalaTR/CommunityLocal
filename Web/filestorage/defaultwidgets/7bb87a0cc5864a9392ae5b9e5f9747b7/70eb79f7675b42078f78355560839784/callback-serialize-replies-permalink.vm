##
## Renders a tree of forum replies for a permalink as JSON
## A specialized form of the replies serialization which also includes
## the permalinked item as well all of the permalinked items parents
##
## Requires in scope:
##   $permalinkedId - id of reply being permalinked
##   $replyWithParents - flattened list of single-threaded parents of reply AND reply
##   $replyChildren - (potentially nested) children of permalinked item
##   $flattenedDepth
##   $replySiblings - flattened siblings (optional)
##
